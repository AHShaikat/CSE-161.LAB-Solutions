# CSE-161.LAB-Solutions
Here,I've uploaded all of the resources of BRACU CSE-161 & 162 including flowcharts note,Handnotes PDF. 
If you are new at leanring programming language,my suggestion to you that not to copy the code from these files,
just try to think about the logic
then you will get the solution easily.
Otherwise,Copy Paste tendency will ruin your coding enthusisum.

By the way,
Best of luck with your coding journey.


#Happy Coding.......
